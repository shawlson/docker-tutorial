    <h1>Swarms</h1>

    <h3 class="text-muted">What are swarms?</h3>

    <p>
        Swarms are a slightly more advanced topic that we won't get too much into. However, we will give you the basics so you can
        pick up swarms when you're ready!
    </p>
    <p>
        A swarm is a group of machines, phsyical or virtual, that are linked together to run docker containers. A
        <i>swarm manager</i> is a machine that executes docker commands and distributes the work to other machines in the swarm.
        Swarm managers distribute the work to
        <i>nodes</i>, the other machines in the
        <i>cluster</i>, with various methods. However, this is entirely customizable by you in the Compose file!
    </p>
    <p>
        The diagram tries to explain visually how a swarm works. As you can see, all docker commands will be executed on the Swarm
        Manager. The swarm manager then delegates the commands to the worker nodes to complete the execution.

    <h3>Setting up a Swarm</h3>
    <p>
        Since most people don't have multiple machines lying around waiting for use, we are going to create some virtual machines
        for the purpose of this tutorial. On your machine with docker installed, we are going to create two VMs; one to be
        a manager and one to be a worker.
        <pre><code>
                        docker-machine create --driver virtualbox myvm1
                        docker-machine create --driver virtualbox myvm2
                    </code></pre> You should now have two VMs running inside docker! To view your vms type
        <code>docker-machine ls</code>. If you don't see two machines listed, there might be a problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        We're almost done! If you're not familiar with the
        <code>docker-machine ssh</code> command, its very simple. It allows you to quickly run bash commands on your VMs without needing to ssh into them
        explicitly. We're going to use this to designate one of your VMs to be a swarm manager. Choose one of your two VMs
        and run the following command using the ip-address of the vm from
        <code>docker-machine ls</code>
        <pre><code>docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker swarm init --advertise-addr &lt;myvm1 ip&gt;"</code></pre> The output from the above command will give you a custom bash command to run on other VMs to allow them to join
        the swarm. Copy that command somewhere so you can use it in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now you can add your second VM to the swarm using a similar syntax as above. Insert the code snippet from the output of the
        previous command at the "docker-command" placeholder.
        <pre><code>
                        docker-machine ssh myvm2 "&lt;docker-command&gt;"    
                    </code></pre> Thats it! You are now up and running with your own swarm! To ensure your swarm is set up correctly, run the following
        <code>docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker node ls"</code> This command will run "docker node ls" on the swarm manager. The output should confirm that both VMs are part of
        the swarm!
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-muted">Deploying to a swarm</h3>
    <p>Deploying to a swarm is as easy as deploying to a single machine. Simply run your docker commands on the swarm manager, and
    docker will handle the rest!</p>
