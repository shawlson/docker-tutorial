<h1>Part 2: Containers</h1>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Install Docker Version 1.13 or higher.</li>
	<li>Read Orientation or Part 1</li>
	<li>Run docker and try a quick test run to make sure that everything is working fine:
		<code>docker run hello-world</code>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Introduction and Development Environment</h2>
<p>A docker app is divided in 3 parts: <ul><li>Stack</li><li>Services</li><li>Container</li></ul></p>
<p>For example, if you are working on an app being written in java, the first thing to do would be to install
the java runtime framework and the java SDK onto your machine. This creates a situation where the environment on
your machine has to be in perfect order for your app to run as expected and same for the server that supports the application.</p>
<p>With Docker, this is not nescessary! You can just directly grab the portable java runtime as an image, absolutely no installation 
necessary.</p>
<p>These portable images are defined by <code>Dockerfile</code></p>
<h2>Defining an Image</h2>
<p>A basic way to think about <code>Dockerfile</code> is to imgine it as a settings page. If your app neeeds access to particular resources like networking interfaces or certain disk drivers or packages
you have to manually map ports to those specific things. However, once you're done with this step, you can except your docker app defined in this <code>Dockerfile</code> to run exactly the same everywhere. </p>
<p>All the packages needed by your app are simply mentioned in a file called <code>requirements.txt</code> which is referred to inside the <code>Dockerfile</code>. The file <code>requirements.txt</code> is placed in the same directory as 
<code>Dockerfile</code>.</p>

<b>Type the code in <u>Dockerfile</u> for installing packages: </b><code>RUN pip install -r requirements.txt</code>

<p>This completes our app which as you can see is quite simple! Now you are ready to build your
app. To build the app simply run this command <code>docker build -t *appname*</code></p>

<h2>Running the App</h2>
<p>Run the app, mapping your machine's port 4000 to lets say containers port 80 using <code>-p</code>:</p>
<p><code>docker run -p 4000:80 *appname*</code></p>

<p><b>Congratulations!</b> you just ran your first docker app!</p>
