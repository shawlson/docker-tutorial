    <h2>What is Docker?</h2>
    <p>
      Docker is a platform for running applications in an isolated environment, called containers.
      Containers are like thinly sliced virtual machines, which allow for applications to run securely and isolated without all the overhead of installing a virtual machine and all of its operating system.
      These containers also allow for developers to put an application with its dependencies into a container, allowing for simple distribution of that application that will run the same on every system with docker.
      Docker's popularity has exploded in recent years due to its ease of use and how light its overhead is. Today it boasts more than 25 million users.
    </p>

    <h2>Features of Docker</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Applications are easily shareable</li>
      <li>Applications run the same in all environments, with little overhead</li>
      <li>Since there is so little overhead, Docker is easily scalable to many instances</li>
      <li>Docker containers can be deployed locally or hosted on a server</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>

    <p>
      All containers on a host computer can share a single kernel as overhead, as opposed to multiple VMs all needing their own instances of the VM's operating system.
      These container processes run similarly to how they would on an isolated computer. Due to this isolation, there are no configuration problems to deal with. 
    </p>

    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>
      Docker can be installed on Windows, Mac, and many distributions of Linux. There are also two editions of Docker, Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.
      Community Edition is free and best for people just starting out using Docker.
      Enterprise Edition is a subscription version of Docker for enterprise developer and IT teams building and managing critical apps in production at large scale.
      Once downloaded, follow the installation instructions with the downloaded file.
      Docker commands can be called on your command line of choice.

    <ul>
      <li><code>docker -v</code> to see the version of docker installed</li>
      <li><code>docker ps -a</code> lists the current docker containers currently running or that have been run recently</li>
      <li><code>docker run &lt;name of container&gt;</code> to run a specific instance of a container</li>
      <li><code>docker rm &lt;name of container&gt;</code> to remove a specific instance of a container</li>
    </ul>
