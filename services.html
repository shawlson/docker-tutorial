    <h1>Services, Multi-container Apps, and Docker Compose</h1>
    <p>
        As a modern developer, you've broken your application into pieces that handle different services which
        may need to scale independently. As an even moderner developer, you've written each of these services as
        a Docker image and want to combine them into one functioning Docker application. Enter: Docker Compose. 
    </p>

    <h2>Docker Compose</h2>
    <p>
        Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
    </p>

    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <h4>
        Mac and Windows
    </h4>
    <p>
        On Mac and Windows, Docker for {Mac, Windows} and Docker Toolbox already include Docker Compose. Sweet!
    </p>

    <h4>
        Linux
    </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Download the latest version of Docker Compose from GitHub:
            <pre><code>
    sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.17.0/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose    
            </code></pre>
            Here, the release number 1.17.0 is an example. Check <a href="https://github.com/docker/compose/releases">the official repository</a> for the latest.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Apply executable persmissions to the binary:
            <pre><code>
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose    
            </code></pre>
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Test the Installation
            <pre><code>
    $ docker-compose --version
    docker-compose version 1.17.0, build 1719ceb
            </code></pre>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>
        Connect containers with docker-compose.yml
    </h3>
    <p>
        Let's imagine what a docker-compose.yml file could look like for an application with a webserver, a database, and a network cache.
        <pre><code>
    # The latest and greatest
    version: "3"
    services:
        web:
            image: progessive-tech-firm/our_web_app
            ports: 
                - "3000":"80"
            # ports: 
            #    - "80"
        db:
            image: postgres
            expose:
                - "5432"
        cache:
            image: redis
            expose:
                - "6379"
        </code></pre>
        What have we created here? We took three Docker images - progressive_tech_firm/our_web_app, postgres, and redis - and used them as the basis for
        three services that we defined in docker-compose.yml - web, db, and cache, respectively. You can think of these services being in their own
        isolated network. In the db and cache services, we expose the ports 5432 and 6379 to this network. In the web service, we exposed the port 80
        to the isolated network, and also bound port 3000 on the host machine to port 80 in the Docker container. If we wanted, we could have specified
        only  ports: "-80", which would bind port 80 in the Docker container to a random port on our host machine, but would otherwise have the same effect.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now, we can specify how each of our services should run.
        <pre><code>
    version: "3"
    services:
        web:
            image: progessive-tech-firm/our_web_app
            ports: 
                - "3000":"80"
            deploy:
                replicas: 5
                resources:
                    limits:
                        cpus: "0.1"
                        memory: 50M
                restart-policy:
                    condition: on-failure
        db:
            image: postgres
            expose:
                - "5432"
            deploy:
                restart-policy:
                    condition: on-failure
        cache:
            image: redis
            expose:
                - "6379"
            deploy:
                restart-policy:
                    condition: on-failure
        </code></pre>
        What did we change this time around? We told Docker to run 5 instances of our web service, and limited each instance
        up to 10% of the CPU time and up to 50MB of RAM. We also told Docker to restart any of our services if they exited
        erroneously.

        docker-compose files have many more options, and you can explore further in the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/">
        official documentation</a>.

    <h3>
        Run your app
    </h3>
    <p>
        To start running your multi-service app, simply place your docker-compose.yml file in the directory of your choice
        and run
        <pre><code>
    docker-compose up    
        </code></pre>
        You're good to go!
